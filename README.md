# CharMoral

---

This paper introduces CharMoral, a dataset designed to analyze the moral evolution of characters in long-form narratives. CharMoral, built from 1,337 movie synopses, includes annotations for character actions, context, and morality labels. To automatically construct CharMoral, we propose a four-stage framework, utilizing Large Language Models, to automatically classify actions as moral or immoral based on context.
Our paper "CharMoral: A Character Morality Dataset for Morally Dynamic Character Analysis in Long-Form Narratives" was accepted to COLING 2025.
