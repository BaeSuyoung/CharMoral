**Abstract**: This paper introduces CharMoral, a dataset designed to analyze the moral evolution of characters in long-form narratives. **CharMoral**, built from 1,337 movie synopses, includes annotations for character actions, context, and morality labels. To automatically construct CharMoral, we propose a four-stage framework, utilizing Large Language Models, to automatically classify actions as moral or immoral based on context. Human evaluations and various experiments confirm the frameworkâ€™s effectiveness in moral reasoning tasks in multiple genres.

## Dataset
### Overview
**The *CharMoral* dataset is available at [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w1mV1gzSZqvGSuUgr-Oqje139KMGTgA9s).** It contains 103,836 morality annotated dataset with character's extracted action and surrounding contexts. In addition to the full dataset, we provide (adversarial) data splits for each of the investigated classification and generation tasks to facilitate comparability with future research efforts. For details regarding data collection and fine-grained corpus properties, please refer to **Section 3.5** of the paper.
